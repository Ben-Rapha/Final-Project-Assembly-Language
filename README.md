# Final-Project-Assembly-Language


CS240 Spring 2017 Project – Due Sunday 5/7 at Midnight
Use Logisim to design the following circuit.
Controlled 4 bit Comparator
Design a 4 bit comparator based on the following specifications:
 

Inputs:  	Two 4 bit numbers  A = A3A2A1A0  and B = B3B2B1B0
1 bit control  C where:
If C = 0, then A and B are unsigned binary numbers.  
If C = 1, then A and B are 2’s complement signed numbers.
Outputs:  	
There are 3 outputs for this circuit.  After comparing A and B, the circuit will set the correct output to 1.

 
Requirements: 
-	You are limited to using basic gates (i.e. AND, OR, NOT, XOR).  You are not allowed to use Logisim’s built-in circuits (i.e. multiplexer, encoder, inverter, etc.).   You may however,  use the basic gates to build your own circuits (i.e. multiplexer, encoder, inverter, etc.). 

-	The comparator needs to be built into a sub-circuit (as shown in class), with the Main circuit used to demonstrate its functionality.
